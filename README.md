## Goal
For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

## Methodology
1. Univariable study. We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.
2. Multivariate study. We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
3. Basic cleaning. We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
4. Test assumptions. We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.

## File descriptions
* train.csv - the training set
* test.csv - the test set
* data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
* sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms
